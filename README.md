Quisine is a modern, responsive restaurant reservation and review platform built with React 18 and Vite, featuring client-side routing with React Router, global state management via Redux Toolkit (including RTK Query), form handling with Formik & Yup, and HTTP communications with Axios. The UI is styled using Tailwind CSS, and the app is deployed on Netlify with a backend API hosted on Render.
